# Q1 - (i)
# It asks to find the distribution of X.
# Since we have a fixed number of trials (n=50) and success probability p=0.85,
# the distribution is Binomial.
# Therefore:
# X ~ Binomial(n=50, p=0.85)


#Q1 - (ii)
prob_X_ge_47 <- sum(dbinom(47:50, size=50, prob=0.85))
prob_X_ge_47

#Q2 - (i)
# Since calls arrive on average at a constant rate (12 per hour),
# the distribution is Poisson with parameter λ = 12.
# Therefore:
# X ~ Poisson(lambda=12)

#Q2 - (ii)
# It asks to find P(X = 15).
# This can be found using "dpois" command as follows:
prob_X_eq_15 <- dpois(15, lambda=12)
prob_X_eq_15
